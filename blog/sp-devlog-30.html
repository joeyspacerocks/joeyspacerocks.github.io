            <p>Well that took a while. I finally acknowledged the lumbering, drooling simpleton lurking in the corner of my code. He goes by the name of The Renderer.</p>
<p>This entry is a little technical and has no nice pictures. Boo. Well, I am a programmer.</p>
<p>Simple is generally pretty good and will get you a long way. My 'architecture' is almost non-existent: I have entities (a single structure representing most things in the game), particles (a simpler version) and tile chunks (ranging from full level-size tilemaps to 2 or 3 tile moving platforms).</p>
<p>Previously the approach to rendering was crude. Entities were stored in buckets, each representing a different depth. The rendering loop rendered things in a fixed order - background tilemaps, followed by back entities, foreground tiles, foreground entities, particles, etc.</p>
<p>This was ... ok ... but obviously led to much tediousness in other areas of the code as well as being somewhat inflexible.</p>
<p>The rendering itself was reasonably efficient. I would render tilemaps using a single call with a prebuilt VBO mesh representing enough tiles to fill the screen; just updating vertex uv's each frame depending on the section of the tilemap being shown on screen.</p>
<p>All sprites would be batched up and rendered with one or two calls, as would electrical sparks, which needed the blending mode to be changed.</p>
<p>Water shaders require two passes - take the scene rendered so far and render it with a texture that has had the liquid area masks rendered to it using the water shader.</p>
<p>So ... finally I'd had enough of the fixed hard-coded nature of this and knuckled down to clean it up.</p>
<p>The system now is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>All entities are stored in a single list</li>
<li>At render time the entity render functions are called</li>
<li>This populates an array of 'draw calls' - each represents either a tile map, a sprite, an electrical spark or a liquid mask (the last three are all variations of a sprite) and has an associated depth value</li>
<li>The draw call array is sorted using a simple implementation of a radix sort - the sort key is formed from the depth and the call type / material</li>
<li>The draw calls are iterated over to assemble sprite batches which are flushed to OpenGL calls as material / types change, or alternatively to render complete tile maps</li>
</ul>
<p>It's simpler than it sounds, really :)</p>
<p>Things like rendering liquid layers and other effect compositions are much easier now. If an entity wants to render a sprite that contains liquid (like the organ jars or blood vials) it simply adds a draw call for the sprite and a draw call for the sprite's liquid mask (just another sprite) at a slightly lower depth than the main sprite.</p>
<p>The liquid sprites for a given depth all get collected up and rendered into a frame-buffer in one go, then composed with everything rendered so far using a liquid shader.</p>
<p>I also use this same approach to render the normal water areas - previously I was using a nasty hardcoded function that replicated lots of other functionality.</p>
<p>Anyway, the upshot is that it's all nicely flexible now and means that I can mix and match materials and depths etc. Should mean that I can add more composition effects much more simply than before.</p>
<p>Oh, enough of all this pseudo-technical rambling. I'll stick some screenshots up next time.</p>
