            <p>According to the dates on this blog it's been, let's see, a mere 3 years, 2 months and some number of days since the last entry on this blog, which frankly boggles my mind.</p>
<p>In fact, it's been so long I feel like I need to re-introduce the game I'm working on, titled "Spooky Pooky" (as much for me as for you).</p>
<video autoplay="true" muted="true" loop="true"><source src="images/sp-ouch.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>The adventure takes the form of a 'one-world-opening-up-as-abilities-are-gained' stage (or <em>metroidvania</em> as these things are oft labelled), presented with just two dimensions (three were beyond the budget). It is a broadly set in the  B-movie-sci-fi-horror genre (as popular now as it ever was).</p>
<p>The last post I made ended with a typically pithy predection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I expect the next blog post will be titled "Why I moved from C to C++ to Unity in 3 months".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing so dramatic has happened. In fact work has continued on Spooky Pooky with many accomplishments achieved, the wisdom of which vary greatly and albeit at a timescale more akin to arboreal giants than humans.</p>
<p>Everyone loves lists. Here's one:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rendering engine has been migrated from OpenGL to Vulkan</li>
<li>The windows/audio/input support has been migrated from SFML to SDL</li>
<li>There is a built-in editor for building rooms and the world. Tiled is no more.</li>
<li>Rooms can be edited in-game, flipping between editor and game with a keypress.</li>
<li>Sprites and tiles are being created with Aseprite (previously PyxelEdit)</li>
<li>The engine performs live-reloading of sprite and tiles, which are repacked on-save directly from Aseprite with no export steps.</li>
<li>The engine performs live-reloading of vertex and fragment shaders.</li>
<li>There is a story! Mostly, with some gaps and many things to pin down.</li>
<li>There is a 'scripting' system (not a language), whereby scenes and events can be scripted to some extent.</li>
<li>Items can be picked up, as can weapons, and there is an inventory.</li>
<li>The player can now die! In the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the big things - there's obviously been a fair bit of tiny fixes and the like.</p>
<p>So ... progress of a sort. However, it ain't a game yet so an awful lot left to get on with.</p>
<video autoplay="true" muted="true" loop="true"><source src="images/sp-reflections.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>In the world outside of Spooky Pooky I've been distracted by a number of other little projects, including a <a href="https://github.com/joeyspacerocks/teenypm">little CLI project management tool</a>, and many, many <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">Pico-8</a> prototypes, doodles and even the occasional <a href="https://fistfulofsquid.itch.io/sanity-clause">seasonal game</a> ...</p>
<p>Oh and I've also rewritten the static generator for this blog to add proper tags and pagination (since the devlog entries grew rather a lot ...).</p>
<p>My New Year's resolution (in June) is to try and update this blog once a week with an actual progress report, with the occasionally deeper look at some more interesting things (such as the custom editor).</p>
<p>I'll tweet updates on <a href="https://twitter.com/joeyspacerocks">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Right, I'm off to make a game.</p>
