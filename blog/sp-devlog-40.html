            <p>Some more notes on rendering.</p>
<p>For Spooky Pooky I chuck all sprites to be rendered into a big array - this includes the particles. At the end of the first pass of the rendering process I then sort this array by a few things (depth, blend-mode, shader) then I sweep through it filling up a big interleaved array of data to give to OpenGL.</p>
<p>I flush out this array to OpenGL every time I change the blend-mode or shader. However, at the moment I only really have two shaders - one is just a simple texture-blit (from spritesheet coordinates) which is used for nearly everything. The other is the water shader which blends two textures together with a wibble offset.</p>
<p>The blend mode doesn't change much typically - at the moment I only change it for electrical sparks.</p>
<p>Everything has a depth though so it's possible that I have electrical stuff at multiple depths, which will cause a few flushes.</p>
<p>Typically though most frames are rendered with maybe 6-10 drawcalls (using glDrawArrays with GL_TRIANGLES) to OpenGL.</p>
<p>The actual tilemap I use for the level data also goes into the drawcall and is sorted - this is also rendered with the same texture blit call but from a VBO with static coordinates that covers the whole screen. I offset it by a scroll amount and change the texture coordinates each frame.</p>
<p>So much for Spooky Pooky - QB1-0 was all a lot simpler.</p>
<p>The ships, asteroids, font, etc were drawn with a single call to OpenGL with GL_LINES and the particles where similarly drawn with another call using GL_POINTs.</p>
<p>QB1-0 was only on the iOS though and when I wrote it I was using an iPhone 4 as my base level. So it had to be 60fps on that with no frame dropping. The biggest problem I had was with the 'black-hole' enemy type. These are simple gravitational attractors that basically pull everything on the screen (including particles) towards them.</p>
<p>I decided to render them purely through particles. So they emit particles with a velocity perpendicular to the spin of the entity - this means the particles go into a nice expanding orbit and it ends up being a cool swirly effect. However it took a lot of particles to make it look good, which would sometimes pull the framerate down.</p>
<p>To solve this I have two update functions for particles. If the count is not too high I apply the full physics model to them and let them wrap-round the screen. If the particle count goes too high then particles go through the 'fast' route, where they have a simplified physics model (no attraction) and they stop wrapping the screen and just get returned to the pool when they fall off the edge.</p>
<p>This worked pretty well as if there's that many particles on the screen you can't really tell what's going on anyway :) All told I think I had a max limit of about 10,000 particles for that game.</p>
<p>Of course nowadays I'm sure that an iPhone 6 could copy with a lot more ... plus I'm also sure that there's a lot of other things I'm doing wrong :) For a start I use linked lists a lot which probably means I get a lot of cache misses (even though the source data for the list is from a big contiguous pool).</p>
<p>Hey-ho life can be too short to worry about that sort of thing until you need to ..</p>
