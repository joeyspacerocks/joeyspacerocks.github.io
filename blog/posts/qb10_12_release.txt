<p>Behold the full might of a marketing machine swinging into action.</p>

<p>Ahem. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qb1-0/id580175669?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Version 1.2 of QB1-0</a> was released on the App Store months ago and I've finally got around to mentioning it here.</p>

<p>But that's not all! There's a new trailer as well!</p>

<iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/sif7dsV8yvo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>So what's new? The biggest change is that it's now a Universal app, and so is available for both iPad and iPhone. Additionally there are some graphical improvements and a couple of bug fixes.

<p>There you have it.</p>
