Asteroids and lasers come to the iPad ...

Behold the full might of a marketing machine swinging into action.

Ahem. [Version 1.2 of QB1-0](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qb1-0/id989626858?ls=1&amp;mt=8) was released on the App Store months ago and I've finally got around to mentioning it here.

But that's not all! There's a new trailer as well!

So what's new? The biggest change is that it's now a Universal app, and so is available for both iPad and iPhone. Additionally there are some graphical improvements and a couple of bug fixes.

There you have it.

Marketing.
