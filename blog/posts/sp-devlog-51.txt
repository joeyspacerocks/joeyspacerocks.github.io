<p>Physics stuff is a funny beast .. I had buoyancy working ages ago, but after fixing a few seemingly innocent bugs I realised that I'd completely broken it ...</p>

<p>I can pop arbitrary chunks of tiles out as distinct entities by drawing a rectangular object around them in the level editor I'm using (Tiled) - I can then give them a few properties, such as density, which means that dropping into water will cause them to float. To do this I use a pretty standard buoyancy equations, but the thing that was really screwing it up was adding drag forces - for very light objects (such as those platforms, which have to be light so they don't sink when the player lands on them) I managed to give it massive drag forces in the reverse direction to velocity causing things to explode out of the water ..</p>

<p>For variable height jumping I've really been round the houses trying different things - and then the simplest thing worked, straight out of the Sonic handbook .. pretty much what you do I think - give the max impulse on jump and when the key is released then cap the y velocity at about 50% of the max power .. I was dubious but it works very well ..</p>
