Some liquid-containing sprites for jars and the like ...

You ever add something to a game and then spend far to much time messing about with it?

So then, water ... added some render code so that arbitrary tiles can specify masks that apply the water affect.

Below is a container (will hold the organs that the player has to retrieve) containing some green gloop.

It required a separate rendering pass to the swimmable water (or what approximates to it in my ad-hoc thrown together renderer) so that it can render the background behind and the tiles in front. Just got to find a way to get some bubbles in there that can be masked off.

What you probably can't tell in the GIF above is that the little blood vials that are collectable also have this mask applied - the blood inside is distorting the background. Yeah, I've definitely taken this too far.

Also tweaked the water effect and made another little play level to have a swim. Additionally added another background level of parallax - no idea what to put in it yet. If I had a creative director I'd have probably sacked him by now.
