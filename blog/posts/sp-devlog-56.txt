I'm still here! I think this is the longest I've gone without posting, but I'm still here and working on the game.

I took a break over the summer and messed about with Pico-8 to try and regain some perspective and sanity.

It may not have worked, but let's give it a go anyway.

So, here's some bats. Apparently all games need to have bats nowadays.

I'm in the process of trying to bring some organisation to this mess and, dare I say it, plan the rest of the development.
