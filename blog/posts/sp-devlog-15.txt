Sketching out the intro level.

It's only a small level and you lack certain abilities (such as not being able to jump very high, and slowish walk). Eventually you're corralled into ... The Machine:

Not quite finished yet - organs need refining and I want to add some distortion effects over the whole thing using some shader magic, but it's getting there ...
