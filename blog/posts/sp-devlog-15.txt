<p>Quick update - been working on an intro level where you play as the hero, Horatio prior to being transformed.</p>

<p>It's only a small level and you lack certain abilities (such as not being able to jump very high, and slowish walk). Eventually you're corralled into ... The Machine:</p>

<p>Not quite finished yet - organs need refining and I want to add some distortion effects over the whole thing using some shader magic, but it's getting there ...</p>
