<p>Just decided - Spooky Pooky is morphing into a Metroidvania game.</p>

<p>I've been leaning towards this for a while now as I've felt that it better fits the organ / power-up mechanism and story-wise it just makes sense for Horatio's quest to be restored to his human self to take place in a single large world, rather than broken into levels.</p>

<p>Technically it's not a massive change to what I have at the moment. I'm going to spend a little time knocking the story into shape and planning how the exploration of the world will take place.</p>
