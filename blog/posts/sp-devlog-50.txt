<p>My how time flies.</p>

<p>Despite appearances, work is continuing - here's a little list of minor accomplishments to make myself feel better:</p>

<ul>
<li>Variable-height jumping finally fixed</li>
<li>Judder when doing a little jump on moving platforms fixed</li>
<li>Buoyancy problems fixed</li>
<li>Physics collisions and responses broken by previous two fixes .. um .. fixed</li>
<li>Gun removed - skeletons don't hold guns silly, they fire lasers from their EYES!</li>
<li>Auto-aiming (within a certain range / angle) implemented</li>
<li>Yet another odd machine added - possibly a save point</li>
<li>Some idle animations added</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone loves lists. Look at all those things I can tick off the list I didn't write them on. Unfortunately I haven't ticked off anything that actually was on the list.</p>

<p>Here's some GIFs.</p>

<p>I'm desperately trying to focus now to give some structure to the game and get some real content built. The fact I'm here writing this shows how easily distracted I am ...</p>
