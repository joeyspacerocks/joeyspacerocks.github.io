<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a> (great tip-off from <a href="http://twitter.com/dekdev">dek</a>) I got an XBox 360 controller working very nicely with the game.</p>

<p>Owing to how GLFW works I had to replace my lovely Mac-specific application launch code with a much simpler (and cross-platform) C file that uses GLFW to create the window + OpenGL context so that I could hook into it's input functions.</p>

<p>Much nicer now plus there's the added bonus that more of it should work cross-platform now.</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure how reliable the controller joystick and button mapping will be for different controllers - only got the one so not an easy thing to test right now.</p>
