Introducing abilities through gameplay.

So a little update - I've pretty much finished level 2 of my first demo set of levels.

Aim was to give the player some space to get used to jumping whilst introducing the idea that electricity hurts. Nothing too exciting or revolutionary so I may go back to it later after I have some real enemies sorted.

At this resolution the whole thing just looks like a load of white lines - later levels will start to break this up as at the start you're still in the lab complex before you descend to the more outlandish depths ...

Moving on to the next bit now where I'll introduce some enemies and the first power-ups. Specifically the heart which will give you strength to push stuff around, but the downside that if you over-exert things will start to look a little crazy ...
