<p>So a little update - I've pretty much finished level 2 of my first demo set of levels.</p>

<p>Aim was to give the player some space to get used to jumping whilst introducing the idea that electricity hurts. Nothing too exciting or revolutionary so I may go back to it later after I have some real enemies sorted.</p>

<p>At this resolution the whole thing just looks like a load of white lines - later levels will start to break this up as at the start you're still in the lab complex before you descend to the more outlandish depths ...</p>

<p>Moving on to the next bit now where I'll introduce some enemies and the first power-ups. Specifically the heart which will give you strength to push stuff around, but the downside that if you over-exert things will start to look a little crazy ...</p>
