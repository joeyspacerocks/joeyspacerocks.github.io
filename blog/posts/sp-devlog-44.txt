<p>Finally got the minimap working. Surprisingly it was rather difficult .. or at least, pretty messy.</p>

<p>In the end I keep an array hanging around that I plot the player's progress around the world in, as they move between rooms and room cells.</p>

<p>Written a whole bunch of code that had me swearing after pretty much every line and littering it with "FIXME: tidy this up later" comments.</p>

<p>Thank Venkman that I'm the only dev on this thing .. wouldn't want anyone else to see this particular implementation ..</p>
