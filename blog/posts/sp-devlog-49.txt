<p>I've started floundering again. It all began when I started to design (!) the save-game / checkpoint device.</p>

<p>My first attempt was this:</p>

<p>Nice effect (with some more polish) but doesn't exactly scream checkpoint.</p>

<p>Regardless I decided to add some shader effects to make it warp and seem more energetic:</p>

<p>To implement this I've added an extra drawcall type into my render system for full-screen post-processing. This allows me to render the buffer-so-far using an arbitrary shader, and I can insert this at any depth I like.</p>

<p>So, the extra render tech will be useful, but as an effect this sucks a bit and doesn't really fit the asthetic at all.</p>

<p>So abandoning this I went full pixel and made this little beauty:</p>

<p>Now I'm quite proud of the machine in this one - with some glow effects and some electricity when it's on it might be quite effective.</p>

<p>However. It's still not a checkpoint! So now I've got two 'machines' and I don't know what either of them does, and still nothing to save the game with.</p>

<p>Like I said. Floundering.</p>
