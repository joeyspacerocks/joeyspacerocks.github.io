Dear diary. Progress has been slow over the last few weeks due to various ailments. Winter, huh.

Still, I've been fleshing out the intro level where you begin as Horatio and end with the transformation.

Basic premise is that Horatio stumbles into a disused lab area that he shouldn't be in - at the end the player ends up in the machine.

Added some transitions between levels to show little captions, and cleaned up the state management code a bit.

So next up is to build some real levels and finally get some sample gameplay with enemies nailed down.
