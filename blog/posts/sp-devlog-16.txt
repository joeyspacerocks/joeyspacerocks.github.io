<p>Dear diary. Progress has been slow over the last few weeks due to various ailments. Winter, huh.</p>

<p>Still, I've been fleshing out the intro level where you begin as Horatio and end with the transformation.</p>

<p>Basic premise is that Horatio stumbles into a disused lab area that he shouldn't be in - at the end the player ends up in the machine.</p>

<p>Added some transitions between levels to show little captions, and cleaned up the state management code a bit.</p>

<p>So next up is to build some real levels and finally get some sample gameplay with enemies nailed down.</p>
