So then, this week I've been continuing the elemental theme and have been crafting an electrical demon. Or something.

It's using the same approach I took with the titles but I've made it generic now.

Any sprite (including sprites in animations) can have an associated point-cloud (simply an array of vectors) indicating non-blank pixels.

At render time I can then use the algorithm I'm using with the titles to generate electrical sparks between random points in the sprite, within a threshold distance. The sparks hang about for a bit and fade out.

Nice thing about this is I can also do other things with the point-cloud, like emit particles:

The actual sprite I'm using for this is just for testing, but due to the nature of the rendering can be extremely crude:

I think you'll agree that that is just a doggone work of art. You can see now why I have to prop up the art with effects ...
