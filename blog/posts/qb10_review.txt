A lovely review of QB1-0 by Indie Game Enthusiast

[Indie Game Enthusiast](http://indiegameenthusiast.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/ios-spotlight-80-qb1-0.html) posted a really good review for QB1-0 the other day ...

> QB1-0 released in 2012. It received a Universal update in May, a new trailer in June. I just discovered the game today. Searching online, I couldn't find a single review and that's a damn shame. If you're a fan of arcade shooters, I recommend giving QB1-0 a try ......a stylish frenetic arcade shooter with responsive controls, that fills the screen with particles and enemies and bullets, and for that reason, I think QB1-0 is worth checking out if you enjoy these kinds of games.

The site is performing a brilliant service for indie gaming by championing the many overlooked games that might not otherwise be seen. [Check out the full review.](http://indiegameenthusiast.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/ios-spotlight-80-qb1-0.html)
