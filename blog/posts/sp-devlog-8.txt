<p>I've been tweaking the system a bit so that I can properly attach entities in Tiled maps to other moving things.</p>

<p>Below is a laser/forcefield attached to the moving platform. Had some fun messing about with particles to add some steam where the laser hits the water and sparks for the ground.</p>

<p>I've also zoomed out a bit so that you can see more of the play area - will give me more options for level design.</p>

<p>Next up is some title / menu design and hopefully some power-ups - i.e. collectable organs that'll affect game play in some way.</p>
