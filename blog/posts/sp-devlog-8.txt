I've been tweaking the system a bit so that I can properly attach entities in Tiled maps to other moving things.

Below is a laser/forcefield attached to the moving platform. Had some fun messing about with particles to add some steam where the laser hits the water and sparks for the ground.

I've also zoomed out a bit so that you can see more of the play area - will give me more options for level design.

Next up is some title / menu design and hopefully some power-ups - i.e. collectable organs that'll affect game play in some way.
