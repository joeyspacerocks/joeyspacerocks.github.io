Linking entities together for extendable logic.

Spent a while re-jigging my embryonic entity system so that things can be associated with other things (for example buttons can turn off forcefields).

To accompany this I rewrote the Tiled level loader to take advantage of it's object layers, specifically using the properties to specify the relationships between entities.

In between small bouts of coding (getting harder to fit in) I've been reading a fair bit about platformer level design. I still haven't decided exactly what kind of game this will end up being - I'm veering towards puzzles rather than out-and-out action, but may make it a bit of a mix between the two.

When I started out the aim was to create an homage to Chuckie Egg and Jet Set Willy (dating myself here) - so I need to reign in the scope a little here to make sure I can finish the thing.

Some of the things I've been reading:


* [How to design levels for a platformer](http://devmag.org.za/2011/07/04/how-to-design-levels-for-a-platformer/)
* [Making Platforming Games](http://subtractivedesign.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/making-platforming-games.html)


Lots of interesting advice there.

Hopefully going to pick up the pace a little from here on.
