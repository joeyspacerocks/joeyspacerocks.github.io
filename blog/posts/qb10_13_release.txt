A small update this time, but I fixed a few things that have annoyed me since the original launch:


* iPhone 6/6+ native resolution support
* Fix to off-screen spawning of enemies preventing delays before they arrive
* Cleared link to instructions on title screen* Minor tweak to firing spread
* Upgraded Game Centre integration&nbsp;to remove deprecated calls
* App Store preview video


QB1-0 plays really well on an iPhone 6 so I'm pretty pleased with it.

I'm looking forwards to the reboot project where I'm aiming to expand the game&nbsp;in some new directions.
