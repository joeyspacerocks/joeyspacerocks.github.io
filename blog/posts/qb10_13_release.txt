<p>Version 1.3 of QB1-0 was released to the App Store today!</p>

<p>A small update this time, but I fixed a few things that have annoyed me since the original launch:</p>

<ul>
    <li>iPhone 6/6+ native resolution support</li>
    <li>Fix to off-screen spawning of enemies preventing delays before they arrive</li>
    <li>Cleared link to instructions on title screen</li><li>Minor tweak to firing spread</li>
    <li>Upgraded Game Centre integration&nbsp;to remove deprecated calls</li>
    <li>App Store preview video</li>
</ul>

<p>QB1-0 plays really well on an iPhone 6 so I'm pretty pleased with it.</p>

<p>I'm looking forwards to the reboot project where I'm aiming to expand the game&nbsp;in some new directions.</p>
