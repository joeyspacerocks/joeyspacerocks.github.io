<p>Made a robot controlled by a brain in a jar. Plus some bang bangs and explosions.</p>

<p>Toying with the idea of making this a mini-boss where that brain is yours and you need to defeat it in order to claim the 'brain' power-up. This'll give you the ability to 'remember' how you got to be a skeleton in a jar and trigger a playable flashback as human Horatio stumbling across the machine in the lab.</p>

<p>Of course, what I was supposed to be doing this week was the proper UI stuff - y'know menus and stuff.</p>

<p>But yeah, robot + brain + jar. Ho hum.</p>
