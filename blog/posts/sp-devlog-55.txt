Here's a little update - been fleshing out some of the audio recently as can be seen/heard in the vid below.

It's all very WIP - helped show up a silly issue where I just pile in more sounds as needed until I run out of 'bandwidth' and more important sounds get ignored. So I need to keep track of what's playing and ensure that I impose simultaneous limits on the same sounds plus give others precedence. Hopefully it won't really need to get that complicated but I'll plan for it just in case.

The overall sound design can be summed up as 'weird' and 'glitchy', rather than overtly retro or 'realistic'.
