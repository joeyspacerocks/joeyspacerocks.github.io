So I've been messing about with guns a bit.

Some bang-bang explodey action ...

I'm having too much fun messing about those - it's distracting me.

Still can't decide if I'm going to let you shoot back or not. I didn't set out to make a shooter, but it just seems pretty unfair not to be able to defend yourself ...
