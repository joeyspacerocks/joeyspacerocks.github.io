<p>So I've been messing about with guns a bit.</p>

<p>Some bang-bang explodey action ...</p>

<p>An annoying blob gun ...</p>

<p>I'm having too much fun messing about those - it's distracting me.</p>

<p>Still can't decide if I'm going to let you shoot back or not. I didn't set out to make a shooter, but it just seems pretty unfair not to be able to defend yourself ...</p>
