<p>Cross-platform is starting to become more of a reality now. Finally got my terrible rendering code running on a Mac.</p>

<p>The game runs at 480x272 and plays really nicely full screen.</p>

<p>Next up is to add controller support and then I'll tackle the real issue of metroidvania-ing the level loading.</p>
