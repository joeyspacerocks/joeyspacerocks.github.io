So I'm still plugging away at Spooky Pooky after a short interlude whilst I patched up QB1-0 with an iPhone 6+ fix.

Latest update is to tidy up some of the physics code so that I could impart some physically implausible reaction forces to platforms when landed on.

Similarly for floating platforms, albeit a bit more subtlety.

Tweaking this kind of stuff is really just a way of getting back into the flow of it after a bit of a creative slump. Going to change the control system next to try and improve gameplay as at the moment it's really just too twitchy.
