<p>So I'm still plugging away at Spooky Pooky after a short interlude whilst I patched up QB1-0 with an iPhone 6+ fix.</p>

<p>Latest update is to tidy up some of the physics code so that I could impart some physically implausible reaction forces to platforms when landed on.</p>

<p>Similarly for floating platforms, albeit a bit more subtlety.</p>

<p>Tweaking this kind of stuff is really just a way of getting back into the flow of it after a bit of a creative slump. Going to change the control system next to try and improve gameplay as at the moment it's really just too twitchy.</p>
