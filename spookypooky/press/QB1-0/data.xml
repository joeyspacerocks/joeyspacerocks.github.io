	<description>
	QB1-0 is a 2D arcade space shooter game for iOS devices where you can't slow down, you can't stop shooting and, ultimately, you can't survive. Playing as a lone pilot, trapped in space and facing endless waves of enemies, how long before you're overwhelmed?

The gameplay is a nod to past classics with short, intense games, neo-retro vector graphics and a control system uniquely tailored to touch screen devices.

Features such as always on auto-fire and auto-thrust help deliver a more intense, frantic experience, especially as the difficulty increases. The addition of being able to boost the ship using a simple flick gesture adds depth to the gameplay without over-complicating the controls.

The wave difficulty ramps up quickly to encourage a just-one-more-go feeling when it's game over.

The name QB1-0 is derived from 'cubewano' - a classical low-eccentricity Kuiper belt object. Yes, space rocks.
