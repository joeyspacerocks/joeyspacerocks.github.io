	<description>
	Spooky Pooky is a 2D platformer mixing action, exploration and puzzle solving.
	You take the role of Horatio Bones, a hapless employee of Nefarious Big Science labs who, working late one night, stumbles across The Machine. His organs and fluid are extracted and bottled, discarding him as a living skeleton.
	Horatio must now wander the complex and the strange world that lies beneath in a quest to restore himself.
	Along the way he will find and use organs that will grant him additional abilities but at the same time may render him more vulnerable. For example, lungs will enable him to swim in water, but he will then be at risk of drowning.

	<history>
	Spooky Pooky began life around two years ago as an homage to 8-bit platfomers such as Chuckie Egg and Jet Set Willy. Over the intervening period the scope has expanded somewhat to include elements of exploration and discovery.
